Landing Page Project
Overview
This project is part of the Odin Project curriculum. It's a continuation of the journey I started with the Odin Recipes project, which helped me solidify my understanding of HTML. Now, I'm delving deeper into CSS by building a landing page that will challenge me to apply design principles, flexbox, and layout techniques.

Odin Recipes Project
In my previous project, Odin Recipes, I created a simple webpage with multiple recipe pages. It was an exciting and fulfilling project that helped me grasp the fundamentals of HTML, linking between pages, and structuring content. The journey through that project fueled my passion for web development and solidified my dedication to the path of becoming a full-stack developer.

Current Project: Landing Page
Now, I am thrilled to move onto the Landing Page project. This project will focus on:

Implementing CSS Flexbox for responsive design
Styling elements using advanced CSS properties
Structuring a professional-looking landing page
This is a step further into mastering front-end development, and I am passionate about building a solid foundation in CSS.
